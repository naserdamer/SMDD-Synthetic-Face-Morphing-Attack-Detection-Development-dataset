The pretrained weight of MixFaceNet-MAD model on SMDD training data can be downloaded from this [LINK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qw6YZ3cpaa9UK2-hRfzKWx5rPvRo0h63/view?usp=sharing) (please share your name, affiliation, and official email in the request form).

## Data preparation
Our face data is preprocessed by the face detection and cropping. The implementation can be found in image_preprocess.py file.
Moreover, for further training and test, the corresponding CSV files should be generated. The format of the dataset CSV file in our case is:
```
image_path,label
/image_dir/image_file_1.png, bonafide
/image_dir/image_file_2.png, bonafide
/image_dir/image_file_3.png, attack
/image_dir/image_file_4.png, attack
```
## Experiment
The main.py file can be used for training and test:
1. When training and test:
    ```
    python main.py \
      --train_csv_path 'train.csv' \
      --test_csv_path 'test.csv' \
      --model_path 'mixfacenet_SMDD' \
      --is_train True \
      --is_test True \
      --output_dir 'output' \
    ```
2. When test by using pretrained weight, first download the model and give the model path:
    ```
    python main.py \
      --test_csv_path 'test.csv' \
      --model_path 'mixfacenet_SMDD' \
      --is_train False \
      --is_test True \
      --output_dir 'output' \
    ```
More detailed information can be found in main.py.
